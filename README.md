# Project Euler solutions in Haskell

My solutions in Haskell to [Project Euler
problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

**WARNING! THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS SPOILERS. DO NOT LOOK AT THE SOLUTIONS IF YOU
WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS YOURSELF.**

As Project Euler states:

> Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing
> your solution outside of Project Euler.

By naming this branch `solutions` instead of `master`, GitHub `robots.txt`
prevents search engines from indexing these solutions. For an explanation, see
[this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/15844905).
